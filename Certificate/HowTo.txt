thargelion.pfx is identical to florida.pfx. It is taken from there and renamed.

Then a pubkicKey is retrieved like this.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.0A\bin\NETFX 4.0 Tools\sn.exe" -Tp ..\Tharga.Reporter.Engine\bin\Debug\Tharga.Reporter.Engine.dll

The public key is placed in the AssemblyInfo.cs file

It anso had to br manually installed on the build server becaue the build failed. I used this command.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\sn" -i thargelion.pfx VS_KEY_AC8E991749895A4C
